Operating Systems projects - Spring 2018


Project 1: 
A small graphics library that can set a pixel to a particular color, draw some basic shapes, and read keypresses, all using only system calls and no C standard library functions. The goal is to better understand low-level handling of system calls.

Project 2:
This project allows one to gain insight into kernel development by extending the Linux kernel's functionality with system calls. In particular, this project implements synchronization to solve the producer/consumer problem using semaphores.
